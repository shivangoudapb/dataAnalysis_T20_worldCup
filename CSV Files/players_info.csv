Ibrahim Zadran,Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Opening Batter,"Top-order batter Ibrahim Zadran is among Afghanistan's most consistent performers, and young enough to have made his Test debut (in the team's third ever match) before he played a white-ball international. He made 87 in that match in Chattogram, a big, historic win over Bangladesh. "
Najmul Hossain Shanto(c),Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"Although he made his debut in 2017, and scored two Test hundreds in 2021, it took Najmul Hossain Shanto more than five years to truly establish himself in the Bangladesh side. But once he did, he was rewarded by being appointed Bangladesh's captain in all three formats. "
Towhid Hridoy,Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"Towhid Hridoy could be the next big batting mainstay for Bangladesh. His 918 runs across formats in 2023, his first year in international cricket, gave the team management a strong option, especially amid a long overall batting struggle from the rest of the line-up in the same period.  "
Tanzim Hasan Sakib,Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowling Allrounder,"Tanzim Hasan Sakib was Bangladesh's best-performing fast bowler in the T20 World Cup in 2024. He took 11 wickets at an average of 13.54, with a career-best bowling performance of 4 for 7 against Nepal. Tanzim bowled with pace, extracting seam or swing offered by conditions and the mostly favourable pitches in the USA and the West Indies. He was so good at the World Cup that the Bangladesh team management couldn't use Shoriful Islam for even one match after Tanzim had replaced the in-form left-arm quick at the start of the tournament."

He got admitted to the BCB's pace foundation and soon caught the coaches' attention to make the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 World Cup. "
Soumya Sarkar,Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Batting Allrounder,"A rarity among Bangladesh allrounders, top-order batter Soumya Sarkar bowls medium pace rather than spin, and occasionally even takes the new ball. "

Shakib Al Hasan,Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,
Mahmudullah,Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"Allrounder Mahmudullah, a middle-order batter who bowls useful offspin and is one of Bangladesh's best fielders of all time, grew into one of the five pillars of the country's set-up in their post-2010 period of growth and relative success. He is in the modern group of allrounders who have aggregated 10,000 runs, 100 wickets and 100 catches in international cricket across formats."
Gulbadin Naib,Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Batting Allrounder,"Gulbadin Naib's first love in sport was amateur bodybuilding, not cricket. When he eventually did take the game up, however, he progressed quickly through Afghanistan's age-group sides as a batting allrounder and was the youngest member of the team that won the Division Five tournament in 2008 - the first stepping stone to the full world stage."
Rashid Khan(c),Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Bowling Allrounder,
Naveen-ul-Haq,Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowler,"A feisty fast bowler with a wide range of slower-ball variations, Naveen-ul-Haq first rose to prominence as a death-overs specialist, but soon developed his new-ball skills to become a useful weapon across phases. Like many of his compatriots, he is an in-demand commodity in franchise leagues across the world.
Born in Kabul, Naveen fled with his family to Pakistan in his early years, and began playing tape-ball cricket there. When they returned to Afghanistan, he began playing with a leather ball for the first time. He was so impressive for Afghanistan's Under-16 and Under-19 teams that his first professional match at the senior level was his ODI debut against Bangladesh, just two days after he turned 17.
Naveen made seven sporadic ODI appearances from his debut to January 2021, and a year later he took a break from the format to focus on the 2022 T20 World Cup. In the meantime, he became an integral part of Afghanistan's T20I side, either side of captaining Afghanistan to a fourth-place finish at the 2018 Under-19 World Cup.
Stints at the BPL, CPL, LPL and the T20 Blast followed as he began to build his reputation. In 2023, Naveen announced he would retire from ODIs after the World Cup that year. He took eight wickets as Afghanistan put in an impressive display in the competition, finishing sixth on the table.
By then, he had made his IPL debut as well, taking 11 wickets in his first season for Lucknow Super Giants, and was also in the news for an on-field altercation with Virat Kohli.
Towards the end of 2024, Naveen along with team-mates Fazalhaq Farooqi and Mujeeb-ur-Rahman got in trouble with the Afghanistan Cricket Board after they asked to be released from their central contracts so they could sign up for more franchise leagues. The board responded by revoking the players' NOCs and denying them further NOCs for the next two years. The situation was resolved with the board agreeing to grant them a limited number of NOCs and slapping them with financial penalties.
Naveen returned 14 wickets in IPL 2024, but it was in the T20 World Cup that year that he really shone. Naveen and Farooqi combined to take the spotlight away from Afghanistan's spinners as they made the semi-finals of a World Cup for the first time. Naveen finished the tournament with 13 wickets, and his three-wicket burst was one of the highlights of Afghanistan's first-ever victory over Australia in any format."

Paul van Meekeren,Netherlands,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Paul van Meekeren drew attention to himself during the World Twenty20 qualifiers in 2016 when he produced a spell of 4 for 11 against Ireland. A trial match at Taunton Vale, plus the success of his Dutch compatriot Timm van der Gugten at Glamorgan, was enough for Somerset to offer him a short-term deal midway through the 21016 season which they extended to a two-year deal until the end of the 2018 season. He made his Somerset first-class debut against the Pakistan tourists and followed up with T20 and List-A debuts for the Club in the same season, catching the eye in a NatWest T20 Blast fixture at Cardiff where he bowled with genuine pace. The following season, in his sole Championship appearance, he took four wickets on debut against Essex at Chelmsford.

But Engelbrecht struggled to take his sensational fielding into other aspects of his game.

Hazratullah Zazai,Afghanistan,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Opening Batter,Afghanistan's ascent up the global rankings from ICC Associate nation to Full Member and Test status has been largely propelled by a conveyor belt of fast bowling and mystery spin. But the country has struggled to unearth quality batting prospects at the same rate as their bowling unit. The emergence of the hard-hitting Hazratullah Zazai is a sign that this may change early in the country's Full Member era.

Najibullah Zadran,Afghanistan,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"Najibullah Zadran packs a punch with his bellicose left-hand batting, despite his slight frame. He has followed the same tried and tested route to the national side as many of his generation that came after the initial Afghan cricketing pioneers, with age-group cricket preparing him for the big stage. His ODI debut, against Ireland in Dublin in 2012, was possibly a little premature but Zadran's batting turned a corner in 2014 and he started to look more at home. In July, his second-innings 99 helped Afghanistan beat a strong Zimbabwe A side in an unofficial Test, and in November his unbeaten 32-ball 60 helped set up a 54-run win over Pakistan A in a Twenty match. He started 2015 well with a maiden ODI fifty, a boundary-laden 83 against Ireland, and cruised into Afghanistan's World Cup squad.Liam Brickhill"

He played a vital role in Trinbago Knight Riders' CPL win in 2020, taking ten wickets at an economy of 5.5 from seven matches. A few months later, at 27, he got his break in international cricket when several senior West Indies players opted out of a tour of Bangladesh due to Covid-19 concerns.

By 19, Harmeet had featured in two Under-19 World Cups. In his first attempt, in 2010, he proved far too expensive for the team management to retain him in the team regularly. Hungry and resilient to prove his worth two years later, his economy rate of 3.02 was one of the best, despite him missing a couple of matches due to being sick.

His ability to make unconventional shots - reverse sweeps and pulls, for example - appear routine makes it hard to set fields to cover all of his scoring areas. Maxwell's audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments. His offspin is better than part time and he has been an outstanding fielder."

He bowls finger spin with both arms, and does it with skill and accuracy - his offbreaks not quite as good as his left-arm orthodox, but not far off. Understandably, his potential has impressed coaches. In the age of T20, a bowler who can spin it away from both right and left-handers, not to mention employ different lines of attack to the same batsman, could potentially have team owners and data analysts drooling, so long as Kamindu continues to develop those skills.

He made his case for a permanent spot in Pakistan's white-ball sides with a hat-trick of ODI hundreds against West Indies in 2016. He was 21, fresh off a strong showing in age-group cricket and a recent international debut in a home series against Zimbabwe that kicked off with a fifty.

His ability to take wickets while maintaining an excellent economy rate saw him talked up as that most frequent of phenomena: an exciting Pakistani prospect. Shadab is not afraid of bowling the wrong'un either; his only criticism might be that he bowls it a bit too often, but that hasn't helped batsmen pick it up any better, either out of the hand or off the pitch. He's also a useful lower-order right-handed batsman, something that has occasionally been witnessed during his domestic career."

Fakhar Zaman,Pakistan,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Opening Batter,"Born in Mardan, where the standard of batsmanship will always be measured by arguably Pakistan's greatest Test batsman Younis Khan, Fakhar Zaman had been on Pakistan's thankless domestic circuit for over five years with almost no attention. A left-handed opener with an unusually high backlift, Zaman relies on raw power for his runs, which he's made plenty of. But it wasn't until the Quaid-e-Azam trophy in 2016-17 that his form began to be noticed.

Unlike some of his other similarly ill-starred counterparts, Wood, despite multiple setbacks, particularly injuries to his ankle, did not compromise his speeds for a longer career. Instead, he 
abandoned the short run-up that had marked his career until about mid-2018 for a longer one that would put less pressure on his body and still allow him to crank out top speeds."

Durham did just that and McCarthy made his first-class debut in 2015.

As of 2022, his ODI bowling average was bettered only by Joel Garner, Rashid Khan and Sandeep Lamichhane among bowlers with at least 50 ODI wickets."

George Munsey,Scotland,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Opening Batter,"Known as the reverse-sweeping demon of the Associate world, George Munsey's path to the Scotland national team is as unorthodox as his trademark shot. Born and raised in Oxford, Munsey had dreams of becoming a professional golfer and it was a golf scholarship to the Loretto School, just outside Edinburgh, that brought him to Scotland at age 13. "
Michael Leask,Scotland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"Michael Leask is an explosive batsman from Aberdeen. He showed as much when he smeared five sixes during a memorable 16-ball 42 in an ODI against England in May 2014. But he has been hampered by inconsistency, and he only mustered 56 runs at an average of 9.33 during the World Cup Qualifiers in 2014. Leask also bowls useful off-spin, taking three wickets in Scotland's win over Tasmania in their World Cup acclimatisation tour in autumn 2014.
Leask played a solitary first-class game for Northants in a tour match against New Zealand A in 2014. He moved on to Somerset ahead of the 2016 season with Somerset's director of cricket Matt Maynard describing him as a ""feisty cricketer"". A scattering of T20 matches were his only outings in his debut season.

Later that year, he took three in a famous win against England in an ODI, Scotland's first. Watt won opportunities with Lancashire that summer, although he only took one wicket in four matches."
